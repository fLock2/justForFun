# Astrofarm

## Introduction

This is a brief project I started working on when I was waiting on an electrician to finish work on my (parents') house.  it was inspired by a CS assignment I had in high school with a similar premise. The program inaccurately simulates astronauts working on farms on various planets. As of this point, it is quite unfinished so I will not go into further elaboration on the details of the game mechanics.

## Compiling

All that you need to do to run this program is to compile the runner .java file User.java. No initial arguments are required, all input is done in the program itself.
